# 11. Show that an orthogonal matrix that is upper triangular must be diagonal.

# Let A be a orthogonal matrix that is upper triangular.
# Therfore:
# A1) A^T*A == I
# A2) All entries below the diagonal are zero.
# A^T*A == I => A^T == A
# If all entries below the diagonal are zero, and A^T == A, then
# all entries above the digonal must be zero as well. 
# Therefore, A is diagonal.
