# 30. If Ax is in the nullspace of A^T then Ax = 0. Reason: Ax is also in the _____
# of A and the spaces are _____. Conclusion: A^T*A has the same nullspace as A.

# Ax is also in the columnspace of A and the spaces are orthogonal. (if "the
# spaces" in this context are the column space adn the nullspace of A)
