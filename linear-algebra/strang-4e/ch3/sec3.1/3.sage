# 3. Two lines in a plane are perpendicular when the product of their slopes is
# -1. Apply this to the vectors x = (x1, x2) and y = (y1, y2), whose slopes are
# x2/x1 and y2/y1, to derive again the orthogonality condition of x^T * y = 0.

# if x perp to y, then x dot y = 0
# x dot y = x1*y1 + x2*y2 = 0
# => x1*y1 = -x2*-y2
# => 1 = -(x2*y2/x1*y1) # negative product of slopes
# => 1 = -(-1)
# => 1 = 1
