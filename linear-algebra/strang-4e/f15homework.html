 (Fall 2015)

 Homework Assignments

<p>

<b>Text:</b>  Gilbert Strang, <i>Linear Algebra and its Applications</i>, 
<b>Fourth Edition</b> 
<br>
&#160 &#160  ISBN 0-03-010567-6, Thomson -- Brooks/Cole, 2006.

<p>

<b>Caution:</b> Although the text of the <i>International Edition</i> of this
book is essentially the same, the problems generally have different numbers;
if you use this version of the book you must submit the correct
problems. <A HREF="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~tumulka/teaching/fall15/550/f15graded_homework.html">Here</A> is a page that
gives the problem numbers for the International Edition.


<p>

The <b>Graded Problems</b> in the list below should be handed in at
the class meeting on the due date.  In addition to being
mathematically correct, your write-ups are expected to show a high
level of clarity and completeness.  <i>You cannot prove a general
mathematical assertion by a single numerical example</i>. (Of course,
one specific counter-example suffices to <i>disprove</i> an
assertion.)

<p>

 <b>LATE HOMEWORK IS NOT ACCEPTED.</b>
 
 <p>

The <b>Recommended Problems</b> do not have to be handed in, but you
are encouraged to work all of them (many of them are short, and there
are answers in the back of the book for the odd-numbered problems).

<p>

<b>Academic Honesty:</b> The homework you submit for grading should be your
own solutions to the problems. Do not copy other student's work or allow other
students to copy your work.
