# 66. Why does no 3 by 3 matrix have a nullspace that equals its columns space?

# pg 91: "The nullspace has the same dimension as the number of free variables and
# special solutions"
# The dimension of the columnspace is the number of pivot variables.
# Therefore for a 3x3 matrix: dim(Null) + dim(Col) == 3.
# Since rank cannot be a fraction, dim(Nullspace) != dim(ColSpace).
